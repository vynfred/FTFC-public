# FTFC Large Dependencies Optimization Report

## Summary

This report provides optimization strategies for the largest dependencies in the project.

## Optimization Suggestions

### Optimize googleapis

The googleapis package is very large. Import only the specific services you need.

#### Example

Before:
```javascript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
```

After:
```javascript
import { google } from 'googleapis/build/src/index';
```

Note: Then use only the specific services: const sheets = google.sheets({ version: 'v4' });

#### Affected Files

- `services/geminiNotesMonitor.js`
- `services/geminiNotesService.js`
- `services/googleIntegration.js`

### Optimize date-fns

The date-fns package is large. Import only the specific functions you need.

#### Example

Before:
```javascript
import { format, addDays } from 'date-fns';
```

After:
```javascript
import format from 'date-fns/format';
import addDays from 'date-fns/addDays';
```

Note: Import individual functions directly to reduce bundle size.

#### Affected Files

- `components/Dashboard/DashboardStats.js`
- `components/Dashboard/ReportsPage.js`

## General Recommendations

1. **Use Code Splitting**: Load components and libraries only when needed using dynamic imports.
2. **Implement Tree Shaking**: Ensure your bundler is configured to eliminate unused code.
3. **Consider Alternatives**: For very large libraries, consider smaller alternatives.
4. **Lazy Load Components**: Use React.lazy() for components that aren't needed immediately.
5. **Monitor Bundle Size**: Regularly analyze your bundle size to catch issues early.
