# FTFC 4.0 Implementation Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for testing the new features implemented in FTFC 4.0:

1. PWA for Team Members
2. SendGrid Email Integration
3. Meeting Notes Capture

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js 14+ installed
- Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Firebase project set up and configured
- Google Cloud project with required APIs enabled
- SendGrid account with API key
- Google OAuth credentials

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository and checkout the 4.0-implementation branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vynfred/ftfc.git
cd ftfc
git checkout 4.0-implementation
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file:

```
# Firebase configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here

# Google OAuth credentials
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your_google_redirect_uri_here

# Google Drive API credentials
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY=your_google_drive_api_key_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_google_drive_folder_id_for_recordings

# SendGrid API key
REACT_APP_SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
REACT_APP_SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@ftfc.co
```

5. Set up Firebase Functions configuration:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="your_sendgrid_api_key" sendgrid.from_email="noreply@ftfc.co"
firebase functions:config:set google.drive_folder_id="your_google_drive_folder_id"
```

## 1. Testing PWA Implementation

The PWA implementation ensures that only team members can install and use the application as a Progressive Web App.

### Automated Testing

Run the PWA functionality test script:

```bash
npm install puppeteer chalk
node scripts/test-pwa-functionality.js
```

This script will:
- Test service worker registration for team members
- Verify service worker is NOT registered for other user types
- Test offline functionality for team members
- Verify PWA installation prompt for team members

### Manual Testing

1. **Build and deploy the application**:

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

2. **Test team member PWA**:
   - Open the application in Chrome
   - Log in as a team member (email: team@ftfc.com, password: Test123)
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Look for the install prompt in the address bar or the custom install prompt
   - Install the PWA
   - Verify that the app opens in a standalone window
   - Test offline functionality by enabling airplane mode and refreshing the page

3. **Test other user types**:
   - Log in as a client, investor, or partner
   - Verify that no install prompt appears
   - Check browser developer tools to confirm service worker is not registered

## 2. Testing SendGrid Email Integration

The SendGrid email integration enables sending transactional emails, including password reset emails.

### Automated Testing

Run the SendGrid integration test script:

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail inquirer uuid
node scripts/test-sendgrid-integration.js
```

This script will:
- Send a test email to verify SendGrid connection
- Test password reset email flow
- Test welcome email
- Test meeting notification email

### Manual Testing

1. **Test password reset flow**:
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Click "Forgot Password"
   - Enter a test email address
   - Submit the form
   - Check the email inbox for the password reset email
   - Click the reset link and verify it works
   - Reset the password and verify you can log in with the new password

2. **Test other email notifications**:
   - Create a new client and verify welcome email is sent
   - Schedule a meeting and verify meeting notification email is sent
   - Upload a document and verify document notification email is sent

## 3. Testing Meeting Notes Capture

The meeting notes capture feature automatically processes Gemini meeting notes and associates them with the correct entities.

### Automated Testing

Run the meeting notes capture test script:

```bash
npm install googleapis inquirer
node scripts/test-meeting-notes-capture.js
```

This script will:
- Test Google Drive connection
- Create a test meeting note
- Test entity matching logic
- Test processing a meeting note
- Test the scheduled function for regular processing

### Manual Testing

1. **Set up Google Drive integration**:
   - Log in as a team member
   - Navigate to your profile settings
   - Connect your Google Drive account
   - Grant the necessary permissions

2. **Create a test meeting note**:
   - Create a new Google Doc titled "Meeting notes: Client ABC"
   - Add content including participant emails (team member and client)
   - Save the document in your Google Drive

3. **Trigger processing**:
   - Wait for the scheduled function to run (every 10 minutes)
   - Or manually trigger processing using the Firebase Functions console

4. **Verify results**:
   - Navigate to the client's detail page
   - Check that the meeting transcript appears in the transcripts section
   - Verify that the content matches the Google Doc
   - Check that action items and key points are extracted correctly

## Troubleshooting

### PWA Issues

- **Service worker not registering**: Check browser console for errors
- **Install prompt not appearing**: Make sure the app meets PWA criteria (has manifest.json, service-worker.js, etc.)
- **Offline mode not working**: Verify cache configuration in service-worker.js

### SendGrid Issues

- **Emails not sending**: Verify SendGrid API key is correct
- **Password reset link not working**: Check Firebase Authentication configuration
- **Email templates not rendering correctly**: Test with different email clients

### Meeting Notes Capture Issues

- **Google Drive connection failing**: Verify OAuth credentials and scopes
- **Entity matching not working**: Check email formats and entity records in Firestore
- **Notes not being processed**: Check Cloud Functions logs for errors
- **Scheduled function not running**: Verify Cloud Scheduler configuration

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing, please report them by:

1. Creating a detailed issue in the GitHub repository
2. Including steps to reproduce the issue
3. Attaching any relevant logs or screenshots
4. Specifying which feature and test case failed

## Next Steps

After successful testing, the following steps should be taken:

1. Address any issues found during testing
2. Document any configuration changes needed for production
3. Create a pull request to merge the 4.0-implementation branch into main
4. Deploy the changes to production
5. Monitor the application for any issues after deployment
